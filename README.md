# AB_Test
This projects contains how to run a simple a/b test by not using the package that been set up in the r or python.
Give you a little bit hit of how the package work.
Also the results will be if the p value that you calculate is larger than the significant level (which normally is 0.05), then we should retain the null hypothesis, in this case means that a is not better 30% than b, if the p value that you calculate is smaller than significant level, we can say that a is better than b, and 30% of people gonna say yes under condition a.
